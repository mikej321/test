## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learnt how to horizontally and vertically center a <div> by setting postion property to absolute so it takes its normal flow and setting top and left properties to 50%. This sets the div 50% relative to the left and to the top. Then set transform property to translate(-50,-50)

```css
.container {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Useful resources

- [11 Ways to Center Div or Text In Div Inn CSS](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/center-div-css#center-div-horizontally-vertically) - This helped me to understand how to center a div.
